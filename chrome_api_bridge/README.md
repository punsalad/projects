Chrome API Bridge extension README
==================================

A Chrome extension written by the Claude AI to allow access to Chrome's API from the Linux command line.

The extension itself is in the (duh) 'extensions' directory. The 'claude_files' directory contains
additional files generated by Claude, which aren't necessary for installation.

The real README is at my blog, Pun Salad, right [here](https://punsalad.com/cgi-bin/ps?spec=2025/08/02/1754130819).
