bookpicker (simple)  README
===========================

Perl scripts to (1) choose an unread book from one of a number of lists,
and (2) undo that choice.

The real README is at my blog, Pun Salad, right [here](https://punsalad.com/cgi-bin/ps?spec=2017/10/30/1509351044).

I currently use a more complex picking algorithm described [here](https://punsalad.com/cgi-bin/ps?spec=2018/07/03/1530632770).
