Projects
========

Well, "projects" is maybe too grand a word. This is a collection of
small Perl scripts, meant to run in a Linux environment, that (possibly)
might be of general interest or use.

- bcd_clock

    A simulated (terminal window) clock, time digits displayed in a
    binary-coded decimal array

- bing_wallpaper

    Scripts I use to (1) download the Bing picture of the day to a
    directory and (2) remove "old" pictures from the directory.

- bookpicker

    Scripts I use to pick the next book to read from my (too large)
    collection of unread books, and to display the current status of the
    collection. The algorithm is based on my own idiosyncrasies, but see
    what you think.

- bookpicker_simple

    A much simpler book-picking script.

- html_cal

    A small script to generate a year's calendar in HTML.

- reading_sched_gen

    A CGI script and associated form to generate a reading page-goal
    schedule for books and magazines. Currently avaliable for general
    use on my
    [website](https://punsalad.com/misc/reading_sched_gen.html).
